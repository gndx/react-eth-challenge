        I'm a Front End web developer. I have experience on the implementation
        of web applications using a wide range of technologies such as HTML,
        CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React and React Native. I considere my self
        with skills like tenacity, calm and persistence that have allowed me to
        constantly become a better developer and expand my knowledge in this
        area. I also enjoy and I am very open about teaching others.
