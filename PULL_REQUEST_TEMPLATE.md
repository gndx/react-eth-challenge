## DESCRIPTION

### Challenge Solution:

I Started with the analisys for the code, the most notorious thing that I saw at a glance were  
React library's dependencies, broken at upgrade from v16 to v18.

It was necessary install dependencies with force flag, fix the root declaration, and some extra configuration for enzyme, jest and eslint.

Since last step all the development was so normal, I did add some skeleton to layout, I refactor to take some code into its own components, I did add styles and I worked over mobile-first's point of view.

The last part of the development was to customize the data.json file and deploy over Vercel service, with a tiny extra effort I did add a serverless vercel function to handle request to a REST endpoint and deliver the data to the front end app
