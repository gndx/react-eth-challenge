## DESCRIPTION

Soluci√≥n al reto:

There were two main blocks that I found:

* The tests were giving an error message. For this one I got help from the community for a given solution to use another method for mounting the specific component for the test

* At the deployment stage, there was an error of incompatibility of react versions between two libraries, I reviewed the logs and decide to roll back to a previos version of react from 18 to 16

The API url is pointing to an endpoint of a service I have deployed in heroku.

The app is deployed to github pages, I added a file deploy.yml in the github workflows, so in every push to github the app will re-deploy.

I added an script in the index.html file for the social media icons from font awesome.
