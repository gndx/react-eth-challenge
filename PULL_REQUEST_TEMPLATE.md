#### Documentation:
- I made a high order component (Section) to renderice the different components and reuse structure. 
- I built the json data structure to be easy adaptable to multi language, I will add a languague switcher later in the CV.
- I integrated a welook link to show my POAP's as part of my resume.
- I made a small project-viewer component, which later will be translated into a carousel to slide right and left. 
- As design guideline, without being a designer, I tried to keep it simply, fresh and mistery-looking.
- I added some media queries, to make the CV responsive and good-loking on mobile, where most of my recruiters will be. (This needs more work, as lately I added the Skills and Projects grid.)
